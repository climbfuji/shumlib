################################################################################

This directory consists of the following files:

 * Makefile:
     The makefile used to build a library from the source f90 files that 
     the shumlib FRUIT test executables link against.

 * Makefile-driver:
     The makefile used to build the shumlib FRUIT test executables - which
     includes simple generation of the top-level "driver" f90 file.

 * fruit.f90:
     The main FRUIT source file, which should not be edited directly; it is
     generated via the Ruby script in this directory.

 * fruit_mpi.f90:
     The extensions for running FRUIT in an environment with MPI; not 
     currently used by shumlib.

 * fruit_f90_generator.rb (and 3.4.1 version):
     The Ruby script which generates fruit.f90 from the .txt template file
     and a list of rules.  This has been modified from the original FRUIT
     source (provided as the 3.4.1 suffixed version of the file).

 * fruit_f90_source.txt (and 3.4.1 version):
     The template file used by the above Ruby script to generate fruit.f90.
     Again this has been modified from the original FRUIT source (provided as
     the 3.4.1 suffixed version of the file).

 * LICENSE.txt:
     The original FRUIT licence file; reproduced here as per the terms of the
     contained licence.

Ordinarily the fruit.f90 file should not need to be regenerated unless a fairly
serious re-working of shumlib is underway; the files are merely provided here
to aid in tracing how the original source was modified.
