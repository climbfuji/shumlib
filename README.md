# Shumlib

What is Shumlib?
----------------

Shumlib is the collective name for a set of libraries which are used by the UM;
the UK Met Office's Unified Model, that may be of use to external tools or
applications where identical functionality is desired. The hope of the project
is to enable developers to quickly and easily access parts of the UM code that 
are commonly duplicated elsewhere, at the same time benefiting from any
improvements or optimisations that might be made in support of the UM itself.

Shumlib Development
-------------------

Note that this Git repository is provided purely as a means to allow public
access to Shumlib, rather than as a base for development - the actual
development of Shumlib takes place on the Met Office's Science Repository
Service at https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/ (this is a restricted site with
controlled access for UM partners).  As a result one should not expect to
see pull-requests etc. actioned directly (issues and feedback are still 
welcomed but will be migrated to tickets within the SRS for development).

Shumlib Licensing
-----------------

Although the UM has a restricted commercial licence, code that is moved into
Shumlib has been assessed and re-classified under the more permissive BSD
3-Clause licence. The aim of this is to allow maximum flexibility and as few
barriers to usage as possible. However we would still encourage the feedback of 
modifications and developments (particularly bugfixes) rather than modified
redistribution.
